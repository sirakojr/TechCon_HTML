          AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a field of computer science focused
          on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like
          intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and
          speech recognition. It works by enabling machines to perceive their
          environment, process data, and act to achieve goals, adapting their
          behavior over time by analyzing the results of their actions. AI has
          many usage examples, including digital assistants, personalized
          recommendations, and smart appliances, all of which are common parts
          of daily life.
